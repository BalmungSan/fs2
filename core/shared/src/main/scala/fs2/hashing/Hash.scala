/** Mutable data structure that incrementally computes a hash from chunks of bytes.
  *
  * To compute a hash, call `addChunk` one or more times and then call `computeAndReset`.
  * The result of `computeAndReset` is the hash value of all the bytes since the last call
  * to `computeAndReset`.
  *
  * A `Hash` does **not** store all bytes between calls to `computeAndReset` and hence is safe
  * for computing hashes over very large data sets using constant memory.
  *
  * A `Hash` may be called from different fibers but operations on a hash should not be called
  * concurrently.
